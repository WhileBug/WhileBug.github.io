I'm WhileBug(Peiran Wang, ÁéãÊ≤õÁÑ∂), a student who is interested in System/Networking/PLSE/LLM/Dataset Distillation. I am pursuing master degree in cybersecurity in Tsinghua University. I graduated from Sichuan University in Cybersecurity Talented Class in 2022. During my undergraduate, I got National Scholarship, and got GPA of 3.92. 

I organize [SCU-Leap-Manual](https://scu-cs-runner.github.io/SurviveSCUManual/) for CS/SE/Cybersecurity students in SCU, if you want to join us, please drop me an emailüòÅ.

My research interest includes distributed system, blockchain, AI security/privacy, PLSE.
